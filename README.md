# Book Store
***This project was made for a subject at university called "Mobile application programming".***

It is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) mobile application for ordering books that has CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionalities, user authentication and realtime database ([Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)).<br />
It's hosted on [Expo](https://expo.dev/), a framework and a platform for universal React applications. For application state management [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) was used, an open-source JavaScript library.
